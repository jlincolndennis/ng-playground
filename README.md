#How To Do This

##Note: We recommend already knowing how to do this, it makes doing it much easier!

1. Make directory, `git init`, `npm init -y`
2. Change 'test' script to 'start' using this value

  ```json
  "start": "http-server -c-1 -o"
  ```

3. touch index.html
4. Make an 'awesome' README and take notes.
5. Just trust the process, I guess? You'll either get it or you won't. And if you don't, who cares? It's not your future, or anything!
6. Add bootstrap CDN
7. Add jQuery CDN
8. Add AngularJS CDN
9. add `ng-app` as attribute to html
10. put `{{1+2}}` in to test
